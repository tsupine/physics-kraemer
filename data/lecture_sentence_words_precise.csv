lecture,sentence
0,good day to you.
0,we are here in location.
0,and we are here today to recreate a famous experiment in the history of physics experiment where galileo dropped a cannon ball off the leaning tower of pisa.
0,so we are going to be dropping a several things off of a tall building today.
0,and one of the things we will be doing is we will be dropping a basketballs of different sizes from the buildings.
0,ah this is a standard to regulation basketball over here.
0,and this is a smaller basketball about one sixth of the size and note that the major difference in diameter.
0,that is going to be important in our explanation.
0,and then we will be doing another drop of these two balls right here.
0,this is a standard issue of golf ball.
0,and this is a so called golf practice ball over here.
0,we are also going to be making physics fruit salad today.
0,and we are going to be dropping several different kinds of fruit off of the off of the off of the building to see what happens.
0,we will be dropping some large watermelons here.
0,this is a seedless watermelon it weighs about twelve pounds or so.
0,this is a mini watermelon it weighs about has about half the way to weighs about five to six pounds or so.
0,and then in combinations that will also be dropping different fruits of their smaller.
0,for example we will be dropping a lemon.
0,so that is the background behind what we will be doing.
0,and now all we need to do is we need this building to drop the fruits off.
0,the next time that they were going to drop will be a large watermelon and a small watermelon.
0,okay guys get ready.
0,ready drop on cue.
0,now that had a rather spectacular end but again you saw that they came down at different speeds.
0,again then we will have to analyze much more closely to be able to hook to park out what is going on.
0,but they did come down at different speeds.
0,so let us analyze these data.
0,one of the problems with this experiment and with galileo's is that things happened so quickly.
0,the time of flight if you can call it that from the top of the building to the bottom is about two seconds.
0,this means a small variations in things like time of release can produce large apparent changes in the outcome at the end.
0,the trick is to analyze the motion so that these other things can be minimized.
0,this is where modern technology comes to the rescue.
0,modern video cameras are essentially very fast still cameras stringing together sequential images at a rate of about thirty frames per second.
0,our eyes can only process images it at a rate of about fifteen to twenty frames per second.
0,this is why the faster sequences in a video clip appear to us as smooth motion.
0,but with the appropriate technology we can take this video clips and analyzed them in frame by frame so that we can follow a motion to a resolution of about thirty three milliseconds per frame.
0,it is not perfect but it is better than our eyes can do.
0,that is exactly what we are going to do.
0,we will follow time of flight of falling bodies and use our technology to correct for whatever complications we can.
0,here we are going to be dropping objects that have similar densities but different diameters.
0,large watermelon versus small watermelon.
0,first let us see what happens with the watermelons.
0,again there was a slight delay in releasing the small melon.
0,but correcting for that we see a result satisfyingly close to what galileo said we should find.
0,despite one weighing about half the other there is virtually no difference in time of flight.
0,why do they hit the ground at the same time.
0,because both were quite large and heavy gravity was a larger force acting on them throughout the fall.
0,of course due to the difference in sizes they had different drag but it is negligible compared to the difference in their mass.
0,then why they are falling at almost the same rate even if they have different masses.
0,why does not greater mass make the large watermelon fall any faster.
0,the answer is inertia.
0,the large watermelon clearly has more mass but it also has more inertia which means it is also more sluggish.
0,small watermelon has less mass but it is easy to move.
0,and what is really important is that the ratio force to inertia is the same for all objects.
0,although there was a slight delay in releasing the small melon you can see they are falling at the same rate.
0,despite one weighing about half the other when the air resistance is negligible there is virtually no difference in time of flight.
0,the next object that we are going to drop will be the two basketballs of different sizes.
0,and you can see them up there in the window of our insectary here.
0,and on my signal they are going to drop them.
0,ready drop.
0,and what you saw there was that the balls came down at positions part of that was due to being released at slightly different times.
0,we can correct for that when we analyze the motions a little bit later.
0,let us start with our falling basketballs.
0,as it was evident at the time the two balls are not dropped simultaneously.
0,taking a frame from a video clip we can see this clearly and quantify the lag.
0,the small basketball was dropped about seven frames about two hundreds and thirty four milliseconds later than the big basketball.
0,let us watch this video again.
0,you can see the flight of the two balls is very similar but not quite.
0,specifically the small basketball falls a little faster about sixty seven milliseconds faster to be precise than the large basketball does.
0,now we need to think about air resistance and how it affects falling objects.
0,first how much does it slow down the object.
0,there are two major factors that affect air resistance.
0,surface area and velocity.
0,if you think about the size of a parachute you can understand the larger one will experience greater air resistance.
0,and if you ever have stuck your arm out of the window in a moving car you will feel a lot more drag when the car is moving fast.
0,either way makes you encounter more air molecules and increases air resistance.
0,so going back to the basketballs they were accelerating at the same rate.
0,but air resistance was greater for a large basketball so this difference made small basketball fall faster.
0,then why did not we take into account air resistance in the watermelons.
0,because of their large momentum.
0,the larger the mass the larger the momentum and the more force you need to change its motion.
0,but the force of air resistance depends on its surface area and velocity.
0,it does not depend on the mass.
0,so in watermelon experiments air resistance is a relatively insignificant compared to their large momentum and it does not change their motion that much.
1,the next objects we will drop will be the golf ball and the small wiffle ball.
1,ready ron drop now.
1,as you have seen the two balls come down at remarkably different speeds.
1,and we will have to analyze this more carefully to see if a size makes a difference.
1,but you see the point consistently heavier balls do actually fall faster than the lighter balls as long as they are in the same diameter.
1,and now for the golf ball and practice golf ball.
1,there was a slight lag in release time.
1,but when we correct for that and measure the time of flight we again see that the light practice ball falls considerably slower than the golf ball.
1,i think we are beginning to see a pattern here.
1,all right here the concept of terminal velocity becomes very important.
1,we have learned that there are two major forces acting on a falling object.
1,gravity and air resistance.
1,let us see how they change throughout the fall.
1,as an object falls through a viscous fluid initially it will be the force of gravity that is the object's weight that will dominate.
1,and an object will accelerate at a constant rate.
1,as it does so however air resistance increases with its velocity.
1,therefore there will be some speed at which the gravitational force is exactly offset by the drag force.
1,here there is no net transfer of momentum between the object and air.
1,there is no net acceleration.
1,and the body falls at a constant speed.
1,this is the terminal velocity.
1,this explains why objects of similar size with different weights follow different rates.
1,the forces on a lighter object will come to the equilibrium at a slower speed than they would for a heavier object.
1,this is why the practice golf ball falls slower than the regulation golf ball.
1,as you can see here the lighter practice ball stop accelerating immediately and fell at a constant speed.
1,this is because at this point air resistance increased enough to balance its gravitational force.
1,so the net force acting on this became zero and it fell at a constant speed which is called terminal velocity.
1,however at the same time the heavier golf ball which had greater downward force was still accelerating.
1,because heavier ball require more air resistance to balance its gravitational force it reaches its terminal velocity later than the lighter one.
1,okay the next object that we are going to drop will be a large watermelon and a lemon.
1,okay guys.
1,ready ready drop.
1,that was interesting.
1,it looks like the lemon actually came down faster.
1,here we see something very interesting.
1,the lemon initially falls faster but during the latter part of the flight the larger melon catches up to it and both hit the ground at the same time.
1,very interesting indeed.
1,every falling object in air will attain a terminal velocity.
1,the only question is at what speed this occurs.
1,and this will depend in part of weight and in part of the viscous interaction of the body with the air.
1,let us go back to the watermelon experiment.
1,they were quite heavy neither of them reached terminal velocity before they hit the ground.
1,if we had threw them at a taller building both would have reached terminal velocity with a large melon falling slightly faster than the small melon.
1,for the lemon versus melon the lemon's overall lower drag resulted in a faster initial fall.
1,but because the lemon was lighter it reached terminal velocity about halfway through the fall.
1,at this point the melon its motion still being accelerated by gravity caught up with the lemon at the end.
2,an object which is falling through the atmosphere is subjected to external forces.
2,one force is the gravitational force expressed as the weight of the object.
2,the other force is air resistance which is also called drag force.
2,the net force f is then equal to the difference between the two forces.
2,for gravitational force it equals to the weight of an object and it does not change during the fall.
2,but we need to note that the drag increases with its surface area and velocity.
2,and when this drag force becomes equals to the weight an object stops accelerating and falls at a constant speed which is called terminal velocity.
2,in this animation we will observe the falling motion of a twenty kilogram brick.
2,and what we are observing here is that the speed of the brick is increasing.
2,and as it does the air resistance is increasing as well.
2,that continues to happen until the upward force or air resistance finally becomes equal to the downward force of gravity.
2,at this point the force is balanced and the object no longer accelerates.
2,every object has a different terminal velocity.
2,in order to predict which one hits the ground first we need to consider their terminal velocity.
2,but at the same time we need to see how high the object will be dropped to understand if they would have enough air resistance to reach their own terminal velocity during the fall.
2,for the golf ball and the practice ball because the practice ball is lighter it requires less air resistance to reach its terminal velocity.
2,but for the heavier golf ball it needs to accelerate and accelerate in order to get enough air resistance to balance its greater downward force.
2,as a result you can see the practice ball stops accelerating very soon as it was dropped.
2,but the golf ball kept accelerating and reached its terminal velocity much later at a higher speed.
2,but for the watermelons experiment both are pretty heavy so they require a greater air resistance force to bring them to terminal velocity.
2,if they were dropped from the height the watermelon would continue to increase their speed which in turn increases their air resistance until they reach terminal velocity.
2,however from this height air resistance could not reach the high level enough to balance their gravitational force.
2,so they kept accelerating and hit the ground before they reach the terminal velocity.
2,the main force acting on them was their gravitational force and air resistance was relatively small to change their motions.
2,so they fell at almost the same rate.
2,for the basketballs because there are not as heavy as watermelons both were able to reach the terminal velocity at this height.
2,due to the fact that they have almost the same weight but the different sizes we can say that the two balls has similar gravitational forces but different air resistance forces.
2,as a result the large basketball which had greater drag force reached terminal velocity soon at a slower speed.
2,but the small basketball continue to accelerate a little bit longer and reached its terminal velocity at a higher speed.
2,after correcting the differences of the releasing time we could see the small one hit the ground first.
2,from the watermelon and the lemon experiment the watermelon could not reach the terminal velocity from this height.
2,however for the lemon it fell a little bit faster initially due to its less surface area but soon it reached its terminal velocity.
2,at a later stage the watermelon which was kept accelerating eventually catches up with the lemon and they hit the ground at the same time.
