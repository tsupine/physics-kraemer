 So I watched the video talking about or looking at a different object in free fall  and they started by saying they're going to recreate Galileo's famous experiment  when he dropped the object off the leaning tower of Pisa  to investigate the nature of objects in free fall.  So the two forces acting on objects in free fall are the force of gravity  and all objects in free fall experience acceleration due to gravity and also working  in the opposite of the motion free fall is air resistance which is affected  by an object's surface area as well as an object's mass and terminal velocity is different  for every object and terminal velocity occurs when the air resistance or the magnitude  of air resistance equals the magnitude of the force due to gravity or acceleration  due to gravity and so all objects will accelerate at a constant or accelerate up into a point  where the air resistance or drag equals the gravity or the force due to gravity, and then they will remain at a constant velocity.  So they started by dropping two different watermelons of two different masses  and diameters off from the same height. And it looked initially  like the smaller watermelon fell faster but when they investigated the actual  like time frames, they saw that both watermelons hit the ground at the same time of impact,  so they spent the same amount of time in the air and there's a discrepancy in the videos  because they released at slightly different times, and the reason for this was  because the small watermelon experiences less, it has less inertia because it is less massive,  and has a smaller surface area, so it experiences less air drag,  so it reaches terminal velocity faster, but then it doesn't continue accelerating  after it reaches terminal velocity, so initially it looks like it falls faster,  but then the more massive watermelon which experiences more inertia and takes and more air drag,  it takes more time to reach terminal velocity, so once the smaller watermelon has reached terminal  velocity and is moving towards the ground at a constant speed, the larger watermelon is  still accelerating and ultimately caught up, catches up to the smaller watermelon  so there are times that in the air it ends up being the same, even though it doesn't look  like that. And then the next experiment they showed was dropping two basketballs  with two different masses and diameters from the same height, oh and also another thing they said  about the watermelon is that air drag might affect the overall speed more except for both the watermelons are both massive enough, that their momentum is large enough that air drag is like actually it's not super important,  it's mostly just experiencing acceleration for speed of gravity so it doesn't look  like they're falling with that difference. And then the next experiment was the basketballs  where it was a lot more obvious that it looked like the smaller basketball fell faster,  but it also ended up being when they looked at the times down that both basketballs hit the ground  at the same time or they spent the same amount of time in the air during their free fall,  and this was more over than the watermelon, the watermelon like looked  like they were pretty much falling at the same even if the smaller one was a little faster, whereas the basketballs was a little bit more of a difference, but it was the same reason the smaller basketball reaches terminal velocity faster, so it's experiencing less air drag and inertia  where the larger basketball is experiencing more air drag and inertia so it takes longer  so it keeps accelerating, initially it looks like it's moving less fast,  but then it keeps accelerating once the smaller basketball has reached terminal velocity,  so when the forces are balanced and then it catches up and they hit the ground at the same time. So here because these are less massive than the watermelon, their air drag is more significant force, because their momentum is smaller as compared to the watermelon. And then the third experiment they showed was dropping a golf ball and the practice golf ball from the same height. And the practice golf ball was significantly less massive although they had the same diameter and the practice golf ball was significantly less massive  so it spent a lot more time in the air, it looked like it fell a lot slower  and the time stamp showed that it hit the ground, it took much more time  in the air before the moment of impact. And this is  because it is experiencing significantly more air drag so it reaches terminal velocity quite quickly, where the normal golf ball keeps accelerating until it reaches terminal velocity much later on,  and so it's able to hit the ground much faster,  and because they're the same diameter, the difference between air drag and surface area is not as even  when you balance them out, as the watermelon has different sizes and the basketball has different sizes here, the golf ball is the same diameter, it's the mass that's the different variable among the two  so that's why the golf ball which is much more massive hits the ground much faster. And then the last experiment they showed were honestly I think it's a watermelon and a lemon  I'm almost forgetting what the larger object was, but pretty sure it's a watermelon and a lemon  and, again they seemed like they hit the ground at a relatively similar time even  though the watermelon is much larger. And I believe this is  because again the lemon experiences much less air drag and much less inertia,  so it can reach terminal velocity more quickly, and is initially moving faster  and then the larger object which is more massive experiences more inertia at first,  but then it was just terminal, it keeps accelerating once the lemon reaches terminal velocity  and hits the ground around the same time, and another thing the experimenter said was  if they were dropping the items from a way higher height, then they would allow the more massive objects to reach their terminal velocity  and stay at it for a longer period of time, but here the time frame was pretty short  so they weren't able to see how the massive objects reached their terminal velocity  and the difference between a smaller watermelon and a larger watermelon.  Because both hadn't been able to reach terminal velocity. And then at the end there's a review  of how surface area affects air drag so a parachute that is larger will experience more air drag  and allow you to move down more slowly so that's a big contributing factor to air drag and yeah.
