 First, I saw the experiment where the big, large, and small watermelons were falling. And I think it has generally... I can't exactly remember the result because which one would fall fast is depending on the height of the building.  But the important thing there was the large watermelon is more tricky to move around. So when they have the same mass density, the larger one is slower at first.  But the problem is that also have downward force is also affected by drag force,  which is some combined effect by air resistance and velocity.  And when this drag verse and gravity force is same, the speed of the falling object reaches the terminal velocity.  But in the case which was shown in the video, because the length of the falling trajectory was not that long, we couldn't...that the large watermelon couldn't reach its terminal velocity.  After that, the second experiment was comparing the golf ball and practice ball,  which have the same density, oh no, which have different density but the same size, that means they have the same air resistance.  But because the golf ball is more heavier, it reached...it took...it was much faster.  But it took.. I mean the practice ball was lighter, which means the force of gravity was not that strong. And air resistance, oh when the speed became faster, it reached the terminal velocity super fast compared to the golf ball.  So after the first few periods, it just fell down with the constant speed, which was not that fast, so that golf ball fell faster than that. And for experiment three, they compared large watermelon and lemon, which have different weight and different size. So in that case, it shows how gravity and drag verse affect the falling speed and their velocity change.
