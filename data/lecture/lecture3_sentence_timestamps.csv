0,an object which is falling through the atmosphere  is subjected to external forces,4.81,10.16
1,one force is the gravitational force  expressed  as the weight of the object,10.75,16.16
2,the other force is  air resistance  which is also called  drag force,16.8,21.24
3,the net force  f  is then  equal to the difference between the two forces,23.00399092970521,27.96399092970521
4,for gravitational force  it equals to the weight of an object  and it doesnt change  during the fall,28.55399092970521,34.79399092970522
5,but we need to note that the  drag  increases with its surface  area and velocity,35.84897959183673,41.09897959183673
6,and when this drag force becomes  equals to the weight  an object stops accelerating  and falls at a constant speed  which is called terminal velocity,42.338979591836726,52.53897959183673
7,in this animation we will observe the falling motion of a twenty kilogram brick,55.23698412698412,59.35698412698412
8,and what were observing here  is that the speed of the brick is increasing,60.46598639455782,64.10598639455782
9,and as it does  the air resistance is increasing as well,64.61598639455782,68.26598639455781
10,that continues to happen  until the  upward force or  air resistance  finally becomes  equal to the downward force of gravity,68.95598639455781,77.96598639455782
11,at this point  the force is balanced  and the object no longer accelerates,79.03698412698412,84.13698412698412
12,every object has a different terminal velocity,86.3129932,89.0329932
13,in order to predict which one hits the ground first  we need to consider their terminal velocity,89.99897959183673,96.36897959183672
14,but at the same time  we need to see how high  the object will be dropped  to understand  if they would have  enough  air resistance  to reach their  own terminal velocity during the fall,97.23,109.82999999999998
15,for the golf ball and the practice ball  because the practice ball is lighter  it requires less  air resistance  to reach its terminal velocity,114.0419954648526,122.7419954648526
16,but for the heavier golf ball  it needs to  accelerate  and accelerate  in order to get  enough  air resistance  to balance its  greater downward force,123.59,134.92
17,as a result  you can see the practice ball stops accelerating very soon  as it was dropped,135.52999999999997,141.92999999999998
18,but the golf ball kept accelerating  and reached  its terminal velocity much later  at a higher speed,143.00199546485257,149.61199546485258
19,but for the watermelons experiment  both are  pretty heavy  so they require  a greater  air resistance force  to bring them to terminal velocity,151.0789795918367,160.8289795918367
20,if they were dropped from the height  the watermelon would continue to increase their speed  which in turn increases their  air resistance  until they reach terminal velocity,163.6739909297052,174.51399092970522
21,however  from this height  air resistance  couldnt reach the high level enough  to balance their gravitational force,176.5179818594104,184.4379818594104
22,so they kept accelerating  and hit the ground before they reach the terminal velocity,186.7759863945578,191.9559863945578
23,the main force acting on them was their gravitational force  and  air resistance was relatively small  to change their motions,192.71698412698413,201.30698412698413
24,so they fell at  almost the same rate,201.7269841269841,204.2269841269841
25,for the basketballs  because there are not  as heavy as watermelons  both were  able to reach the terminal velocity at this height,207.63,216.34
26,due to the fact that they have  almost the same weight  but the different sizes  we can say that the two balls has similar gravitational forces  but different  air resistance forces,217.0239909297052,227.84399092970523
27,as a result the large basketball which had  greater drag force  reached terminal velocity soon  at a slower speed,228.5919954648526,236.7819954648526
28,but the small basketball continue to accelerate a little bit longer  and reached its terminal velocity at a higher speed,237.5019954648526,244.6619954648526
29,after correcting the differences of the releasing time  we could see the small one hit the ground first,246.2909977324263,252.11099773242628
30,from the watermelon  and the lemon experiment  the watermelon  couldnt reach the terminal velocity from this height,255.4149886621315,262.1149886621315
31,however for the lemon  it fell  a little bit faster initially  due to its less surface  area  but soon it reached its terminal velocity,263.0979818594104,271.6679818594104
32,at a later stage  the watermelon which was kept accelerating  eventually catches up with the lemon  and they hit the ground at the same time,272.3379818594104,281.6079818594104
