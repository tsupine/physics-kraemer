0,the  next objects we will drop will be the golf ball  and the small wiffle ball,3.5,8.39
1,ready ron  drop  now,8.97,10.54
2,as  youve seen the two balls come down at remarkably different  speeds,16.1,20.06
3,and well have to analyze this more carefully to see if a size makes a difference,20.06,24.34
4,but  you see the point consistently  heavier balls do actually fall faster than the lighter balls  as long as theyre in the same diameter,24.34,31.41
5,and now for the golf ball  and practice golf ball,36.10299319727891,38.16299319727891
6,there was a slight lag in release time,38.88299319727891,40.55299319727891
7,but when we correct for that  and measure the time of flight we again see that the light practice ball  falls considerably slower than the golf ball,40.84299319727892,47.50299319727891
8,i think were beginning to see a pattern here,48.23299319727891,49.83299319727891
9,all right  here the concept of terminal velocity becomes very important,54.97399092970522,59.74399092970522
10,weve learned that there are two major forces  acting on a falling object,60.38399092970521,64.13399092970522
11,gravity  and air resistance,64.61399092970521,66.61399092970521
12,lets see how they change throughout the fall,67.06399092970521,69.17399092970521
13,as an object falls through a viscous fluid  initially  it will be the force of gravity  that is the  objects weight  that will dominate,69.90399092970522,78.38399092970522
14,and an object will accelerate at a constant rate,79.04399092970522,81.85399092970522
15,as it does so however  air resistance  increases with its velocity,82.40399092970522,87.46399092970522
16,therefore  there will be some speed  at which the gravitational force  is  exactly  offset by the drag force,88.5429932,95.91299319727892
17,here  theres no net transfer of momentum between the object and  air,96.76099773,101.1509977324263
18,there is no net  acceleration,101.6809977324263,103.61099773242633
19,and the body falls at a constant speed,104.06099773242632,106.3409977324263
20,this is the terminal velocity,106.86099773242633,108.61099773242633
21,this explains why  objects of similar size with different weights  follow different rates,109.43598639455784,115.04598639455784
22,the forces on a lighter  object will come to the equilibrium  at a slower speed  than they would for a heavier  object,115.60598639455785,122.45598639455784
23,this is why the practice golf ball falls slower  than the regulation golf ball,123.00598639455782,127.40598639455784
24,as you can see here  the lighter practice ball stop accelerating immediately  and fell at a constant speed,129.35498866213152,136.77498866213153
25,this is because  at this  point  air resistance increased enough  to balance  its gravitational force,138.4429931972789,146.1129931972789
26,so the net force acting on this  became zero  and it fell at a constant speed  which is called terminal velocity,146.5629931972789,155.0029931972789
27,however  at the same time  the heavier golf ball  which had  greater downward force  was still accelerating,157.53798185941042,165.45798185941044
28,because heavier ball require more  air resistance to balance  its gravitational force  it reaches its terminal velocity later than the lighter one,166.20798185941044,175.64798185941044
29,okay the next object that were going to drop will be a large watermelon and a lemon,189.24498866213156,192.62498866213156
30,okay guys,193.42498866213157,194.16498866213152
31,ready  ready  drop,194.43498866213156,196.40498866213156
32,that was interesting,201.4869841269841,202.3369841269841
33,it looks like the lemon actually came down faster,203.03698412698407,206.03698412698407
34,here we see something very interesting,212.96299319727893,214.6629931972789
35,the lemon  initially falls faster  but during the latter part of the flight  the larger melon catches up to it  and both hit the ground at the same time,215.1729931972789,222.0129931972789
36,very interesting indeed,222.5429931972789,223.84299319727893
37,every falling object in air will attain a terminal velocity,228.98498866213157,232.52498866213156
38,the only question is  at what speed this  occurs,233.10698412698417,236.52698412698416
39,and this will depend in part of weight  and in part of the viscous interaction  of the body with the air,237.03698412698412,243.13698412698415
40,lets go back to the watermelon experiment,245.49000000000004,247.85
41,they were quite heavy  neither of them reached terminal velocity before they hit the ground,248.54698412698417,253.68698412698416
42,if we had threw them at  a taller building  both would have reached terminal velocity  with a large melon falling slightly faster than the small melon,254.49698412698416,263.13698412698415
43,for the lemon versus melon  the lemons  overall lower drag  resulted in a faster initial fall,264.0779818594105,270.3179818594105
44,but because the lemon was lighter  it reached terminal velocity about halfway through the fall,270.7679818594105,276.3379818594105
45,at this point the melon  its motion still being accelerated by gravity  caught up with the lemon at the end,277.15000000000003,284.62000000000006
