0,good day to you,0.96,1.48
1,were here in location,1.96,2.97
2,and were here today to  recreate a famous experiment in the history of physics  experiment where galileo  dropped a  cannon ball  off the leaning tower  of pisa,3.06,12.79
3,so were going to be dropping a several things off of a tall building today,14.105986394557824,17.745986394557825
4,and one of the things we will be doing is we will be  dropping a basketballs of different sizes  from  the buildings,18.045986394557826,24.105986394557824
5,ah this is a standard to regulation basketball over here,24.105986394557824,27.245986394557825
6,and this is a smaller basketball about one sixth of the size and note that  the major difference in diameter,27.615986394557822,33.30598639455782
7,thats going to be important in our explanation,33.30598639455782,35.58598639455782
8,and then well be doing another drop of these two balls right  here,36.84498866213152,39.92498866213152
9,this is a standard issue of golf ball,39.92498866213152,41.59498866213152
10,and this is a so called golf  practice ball  over here,41.93498866213152,44.48498866213152
11,were also going to be making  physics fruit salad today,45.50498866213152,48.20498866213152
12,and were going to be dropping  several different kinds of fruit off of the  off of the  off of the building to see what happens,48.41498866213152,54.30498866213152
13,we will be dropping some large watermelons here,55.21498866213152,57.31498866213152
14,this is a seedless watermelon it weighs about twelve pounds or so,57.60498866213152,60.77498866213152
15,this is a mini watermelon it weighs about has about half the way to weighs about  five to six  pounds or so,61.46498866213152,67.05498866213152
16,and then  in combinations that will also be  dropping  different fruits of their smaller,67.51498866213151,72.74498866213152
17,for example we will be dropping  a lemon,72.74498866213152,74.51498866213151
18,so  thats the background behind what well be doing,75.26498866213151,77.47498866213152
19,and now  all we need  to do  is we need this building  to drop  the fruits off,77.83498866213152,82.5
20,the next time that they were going to drop will be  a  large watermelon  and a small watermelon,92.04199546485262,97.99199546485262
21,okay guys get ready,98.0219954648526,99.2819954648526
22,ready  drop  on cue,99.68199546485262,101.5619954648526
23,now that had a rather spectacular end but again you saw that they came down at different speeds,106.3319954648526,110.71199546485262
24,again then well have to analyze much more closely  to be able to hook to  park out whats going on,110.71199546485262,116.2819954648526
25,but they did  come down at different speeds,116.2819954648526,118.87199546485262
26,so lets analyze these data,121.28698412698414,122.60698412698412
27,one of the problems with this experiment  and with galileos  is that things happened so quickly,123.28698412698414,127.51698412698413
28,the time of flight  if you can call it that from the top of the building to the bottom is about 2 seconds,128.03698412698412,132.39698412698414
29,this means a small variations in things like time of release can produce large apparent changes in the outcome  at the end,132.92698412698414,138.63698412698415
30,the trick is to analyze the motion so that these other things can be minimized,139.17698412698414,142.63698412698415
31,this is where modern technology comes to the rescue,143.5829931972789,145.72299319727892
32,modern video cameras are essentially very fast still cameras  stringing together sequential images at a rate of about thirty frames per second,146.41299319727892,153.66299319727892
33,our eyes can only process images it at a rate of about fifteen to twenty frames per second,154.47299319727892,158.90299319727893
34,this is why the faster sequences in a video clip appear to us as smooth motion,159.45299319727891,163.6129931972789
35,but with the appropriate technology we can take this video clips  and analyzed them in frame by frame  so that we can follow a motion to a resolution of about thirty three milliseconds per frame,164.8629931972789,173.9929931972789
36,its not perfect but its better than our eyes can do,174.51299319727892,176.81299319727893
37,that is exactly what were going to do,177.6429931972789,179.22299319727892
38,we will follow time of flight of falling bodies  and use our technology to correct for whatever complications we can,179.8329931972789,185.59299319727893
39,here were going to be dropping objects that have similar densities but different diameters,188.8179818594104,192.6379818594104
40,large watermelon  versus small watermelon,193.0079818594104,195.12798185941045
41,first lets see what happens with the watermelons,196.07598639455784,197.9859863945578
42,again there was a slight delay in releasing the small melon,198.43598639455783,201.25598639455785
43,but correcting for that we see a result satisfyingly close to what galileo  said we should find,201.5859863945578,206.15598639455783
44,despite one weighing about half the other  theres virtually no difference in time of flight,206.57598639455784,210.82598639455784
45,why do they hit the ground at the same time,217.10498866213152,219.32498866213152
46,because both were quite large and heavy  gravity was a larger force acting on them throughout the fall,219.9849886621315,225.6949886621315
47,of course due to the difference in sizes they had different drag  but its negligible compared to the difference in their mass,226.4349886621315,233.66498866213152
48,then why they are falling at almost the same rate  even if they have different masses,234.4029931972789,238.7529931972789
49,why doesnt greater mass make the large watermelon fall any faster,239.3629931972789,243.1529931972789
50,the answer is inertia,245.98,247.55
51,the large watermelon  clearly has more mass  but it also has more inertia  which means  it is also more sluggish,248.19,255.96
52,small watermelon has less mass  but its  easy to move,256.5589795918367,260.4389795918367
53,and whats really important is that  the ratio force to inertia  is the same for all objects,260.9889795918367,267.2189795918367
54,although there was a slight delay in releasing the small melon  you can see theyre falling at the same rate,268.3529931972789,274.21299319727893
55,despite one weighing about half the other  when the air resistance is negligible  there is virtually no difference in time of flight,274.6629931972789,283.1929931972789
56,the next object that were going to drop  will be the two basketballs of different sizes,292.32897959183674,296.19897959183675
57,and you can see them up there in the window of our insectary here,296.5289795918368,299.81897959183675
58,and on my signal  theyre going to drop them,300.1789795918367,302.7289795918367
59,ready  drop,302.8589795918367,304.2989795918367
60,and what you saw there was that the  balls came down at positions part of that was due to being released at slightly different times,314.0,321.2489795918367
61,we  can correct for that when we analyze the motions a little bit later,321.2489795918367,325.32897959183674
62,lets start with our falling basketballs,329.4639909297052,331.1839909297052
63,as it was evident at the time  the two balls are not dropped simultaneously,331.7239909297052,335.1939909297052
64,taking a frame from a video clip we can see this clearly  and quantify the lag,335.8639909297052,339.6339909297052
65,the small basketball  was dropped about seven frames  about two hundreds and thirty four milliseconds  later  than the big basketball,340.0739909297052,346.7039909297052
66,lets watch this video again,347.2339909297052,348.5239909297052
67,you can see the flight of the two balls is very similar but not quite,350.0569841269841,353.0869841269841
68,specifically the small basketball falls a little faster  about sixty seven milliseconds faster to be precise  than the large basketball does,353.5669841269841,361.1969841269841
69,now we need to think about  air resistance and how it affects falling objects,368.7029931972789,373.1929931972789
70,first  how much does it slow down the object,375.7649886621315,378.53498866213147
71,there are two major factors that affect air resistance,379.0449886621315,381.8149886621315
72,surface area  and velocity,382.2049886621315,384.4849886621315
73,if you think about the size of a parachute  you can understand the larger one  will experience greater air resistance,385.4549886621315,392.1149886621315
74,and if you ever have stuck your  arm  out of the window in a moving car  you will feel a lot more drag when the car is moving fast,392.3149886621315,399.5749886621315
75,either way makes you encounter more air molecules  and increases  air resistance,400.2449886621315,405.3749886621315
76,so  going back to the basketballs  they were accelerating at the same rate,406.9789795918367,411.7589795918367
77,but  air resistance  was greater  for a large basketball  so this difference  made small basketball fall faster,412.2089795918367,419.3489795918367
78,then why didnt we take into account  air resistance in the watermelons,421.3639909297052,424.7739909297052
79,because of their large momentum,425.1639909297052,427.0739909297052
80,the larger the mass  the larger the momentum  and the more force you need to change its motion,427.5439909297052,433.3039909297052
81,but the force of  air resistance depends on its surface  area  and velocity,434.55199546485255,439.1319954648525
82,it does not depend on the mass,439.5819954648526,441.37199546485255
83,so  in watermelon experiments  air resistance  is a relatively insignificant  compared to their large momentum  and it doesnt change their motion that much,442.0219954648526,453.12199546485255
