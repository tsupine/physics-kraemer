all right here the concept of terminal velocity becomes very important we've learned that there are two major forces acting on a falling object gravity and air resistance let's see how they change throughout the fall as an object falls through a viscous fluid initially it will be the force of gravity that is the object's weight that will dominate and an object will accelerate at a constant rate as it does so however air resistance increases with its velocity
