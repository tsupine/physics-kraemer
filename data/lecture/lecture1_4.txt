So let's analyze these data one of the problems with this experiment and with Galileo's is that things happened so quickly the time of flight if you can call it that from the top of the building to the bottom is about 2 seconds this means a small variations in things like time of release can produce large apparent changes in the outcome at the end the trick is to analyze the motion so that these other things can be minimized
