 In the video, I learned how gravitational force  and drag force work for falling objects.  In the first experiment, they compared large and small watermelons.  And they hit the ground at the same time, I guess, because they have the same mass.  And even though the large watermelon has more heavier weights,  that is more difficult to move around because of the momentum,  so they reached the ground with a similar velocity and time.  In the second experiment, they compared large and small basketballs.  Small basketballs were faster because it has a large surface area  which is about the air resistance.  So air resistance is influenced by surface area and velocity.  So as shown in the basketball experiment, when it has more surface area,  like large basketball, then it can earn more air resistance,  which is kind of backward force against the gravitational force.  Another one is when the velocity becomes faster, then air resistance becomes larger.  And when the air resistance and the gravitational force become the same,  which means net force zero, the speed reaches the terminal velocity.  At that time, it does not accelerate.  So in the first experiment, when they compared watermelon and lemon,  because lemon has smaller surface area and because it is lighter than watermelon,  it was slow, which means also it was faster to reach its terminal velocity  where air resistance was large enough to cancel out the gravitational force.  So at first, lemon came down faster because it is easier to move,  but soon it reached its terminal velocity and slowly fell down at a constant velocity.  So eventually, the other thing, the watermelon hit the ground first.
