despite one weighing about half the other there is virtually no difference in time of flight. why do they hit the ground at the same time.
why do they hit the ground at the same time. because both were quite large and heavy gravity was a larger force acting on them throughout the fall.

of course due to the difference in sizes they had different drag but it is negligible compared to the difference in their mass. then why they are falling at almost the same rate even if they have different masses.
then why they are falling at almost the same rate even if they have different masses. why does not greater mass make the large watermelon fall any faster.
why does not greater mass make the large watermelon fall any faster. the answer is inertia.
the answer is inertia. the large watermelon clearly has more mass but it also has more inertia which means it is also more sluggish.
the large watermelon clearly has more mass but it also has more inertia which means it is also more sluggish. small watermelon has less mass but it is easy to move.
small watermelon has less mass but it is easy to move. and what is really important is that the ratio force to inertia is the same for all objects.

specifically the small basketball falls a little faster about sixty seven milliseconds faster to be precise than the large basketball does. now we need to think about air resistance and how it affects falling objects.
now we need to think about air resistance and how it affects falling objects. first how much does it slow down the object.
first how much does it slow down the object. there are two major factors that affect air resistance.

and if you ever have stuck your arm out of the window in a moving car you will feel a lot more drag when the car is moving fast. either way makes you encounter more air molecules and increases air resistance.
either way makes you encounter more air molecules and increases air resistance. so going back to the basketballs they were accelerating at the same rate.
so going back to the basketballs they were accelerating at the same rate. but air resistance was greater for a large basketball so this difference made small basketball fall faster.
but air resistance was greater for a large basketball so this difference made small basketball fall faster. then why did not we take into account air resistance in the watermelons.
then why did not we take into account air resistance in the watermelons. because of their large momentum.
because of their large momentum. the larger the mass the larger the momentum and the more force you need to change its motion.
the larger the mass the larger the momentum and the more force you need to change its motion. but the force of air resistance depends on its surface area and velocity.
