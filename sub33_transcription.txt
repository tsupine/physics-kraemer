 So in this experiment they were rerunning Galileo's famous experiment  where he dropped cannonballs off of the tower of Pisa and they did four separate runs.  So in the first run, they did a larger watermelon and then they did a smaller watermelon,  and dropped that from the top of the building.  The second run was dropping two basketballs.  The basketballs were of generally I think the same weight  but there was a smaller basketball with a smaller diameter  as compared to the larger traditional sized basketball.  The third run was dropping two golf balls.  So one was a standard golf ball and the other one was a practice golf ball, and the practice golf ball had a bunch of holes cut out and was generally lighter  than the traditional golf ball, and then the last experiment they ran was dropping a,  I think it was a small watermelon and then the lemon, and again for all of these they were dropping it from the top of the tower. And so in the first experiment with the two watermelons  of different sizes we see that in the video it just looks like they kind of hit,  the larger watermelon hit earlier, but once you break it down through the camera  and timing situation you see that they're hitting at around the same time. And so the researchers talk about how in the case of the watermelon the momentum overrides  essentially the inertia, so in that sense they, even if the smaller watermelon is smaller they're  hitting it around the same time because very little if any inertia is acting on it. But then in the last video when we're doing the recap we talked about how, there are sort  of two forces acting on all types of objects that are falling down from  like a viscous material or just falling in the air. And the arrow going  down is the gravitational force also determined by the weight,  and then the arrow going up is the air resistance which is known as a drag force, and then the sum of these is known as the net force, and so basically  with the watermelon falling from the building there isn't enough time for the air resistance  to really kick in and cause the quote unquote inertia but the researchers state  that if you were dropping it from like a taller building you'd be able to see a difference  where the larger watermelon falls down and hits the ground first, and the reason for why  that occurs is because the smaller watermelon will reach a terminal velocity first,  and a terminal velocity is essentially when the object is falling at I think a constant speed,  and so acceleration is technically zero and so when you're dropping it from a higher standpoint the larger watermelon would be falling at an increasing,  would be falling at I think an increasing constant acceleration, and wouldn't hit a terminal velocity as compared to the smaller watermelon which would. And the reason why the smaller watermelon hits terminal velocity first is  because terminal velocity is driven by two things.  It's determined by both surface area as well as speed, and so the smaller watermelon  that has lower surface area and so there is less air resistance needed  to create the balance, the balance forces and so when the forces are canceling each other  out that's when the, this two forces being gravitational weight and air resistance.  And those two forces cancel out that's when you reach terminal velocity, so in that sense the,  because the smaller watermelon has less surface area it can reach a fast,  no because it has less surface area it, the air resistance is able to cancel  out the gravitational weight like quicker, and so it transitions I guess into terminal velocity faster than the larger watermelon.  The larger watermelon in order for it to reach terminal velocity it would need to fall at a faster speed or essentially just have more time to be able to fall, so you need to drop it  from like a taller distance I think. And these same concepts are applied to the second case  which was with the two basketballs, and so with the two basketballs I think it was the larger one  hit first still, even though they're generally around or maybe, no maybe they fall  at the same time but essentially the same concept where the smaller basketball has less  surface area is able to reach a terminal velocity at a quicker time as compared  to the larger basketball even though they have the same weight, and so in this instance, you wouldn't see,  in this experiment, they didn't see them hit, in this experiment they hit the ground  at around the same time, but if you would have dropped the two basketballs at different sizes  from a taller distance you would see the larger basketball hit the ground first  because it wouldn't have reached terminal velocity as fast as the smaller basketball, and that's just because the bigger basketball has more surface area and so it has more air resistance, and it would take a longer time to be able to reach that terminal velocity as compared  to the smaller one.  The third experiment was with the golf balls, and so again in this situation the one with,  the heavier one with more surface area, the traditional golf ball hit the ground first  as compared to the lighter and sort of less surface area practice golf ball,  and this is again because the practice golf ball had less air resistance to hit against it,  because of its smaller surface area, and so it was able to reach a terminal velocity quicker than, it was able to reach a terminal velocity quicker than the traditional golf ball. And then in the last experiment which was with the watermelon and then the lemon,  in this instance the lemon I think hit the ground first but I'm pretty sure the experimenters  remarked that if you ran this experiment again you would expect the watermelon  to reach the ground first just because the watermelon has more weight and it has more surface area and so this, it requires more air resistance to balance  out and it would take longer for it to reach a terminal velocity  where there's constant speed and zero acceleration whereas for the lemon  because it is less weight and because it has less surface area and less air resistance it could reach  a terminal velocity at a quicker pace I guess than the watermelon and so it would be traveling  in terminal velocity and not accelerating whereas the watermelon  when dropped would be still not at terminal velocity and would still be accelerating  and therefore hit the ground first.
